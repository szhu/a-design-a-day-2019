These devices may be out of date, but one outstanding quality of their displays was that they *were highly visible day and night*.

During the middle of the day, wouldn't it be great to use your laptop with it with the screen facing the sun and reflecting its full brightness, like a piece of paper? Our screens are fancier nowadays yet we still can't do that.

Instead, we currently have to:
- Face the laptop away from the light or otherwise block out the light
- Spend extra electricity to light up the screen
- Calibrate the light to match the color temperature of the ambient light

## Idea

This design is simply a call to having non-permanently-backlit LCD technology in laptops, in order to:
- Allow laptops displays to be more readable in bright light conditions
- Extend the battery life of laptops in bright light conditions
- Make it easier for people their laptops as single-purpose tools such as e-readers, notebooks, weather displays, etc.
- Reduce eyestrain when using laptops

The technology is there, it is cheap and extremely battery-efficient, and it is literally decades old. Please bring it back.
