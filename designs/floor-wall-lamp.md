# Floor-Wall Lamp

## Background

If you want to illuminate a room evenly, the common options all have some disadvantages:

- A lamp that rests on a shelf or table.\
  Disadvantages: takes up shelf or table space, can be easily knocked over, wire can get caught and accidentally pull the light down

- Ceiling fixture lights.\
  Disadvantages: fixtures can't be installed or replaced easily, high cost, bulbs hard to access

- Adhesive lights, string lights, or other lights that can be attached to the surface of walls and ceilings.\
  Disdvantages: requires a lot of DIY, wires can be messy or unaesthetic, brightness is typically limited

## Idea

A floor lamp that leans against the wall, structured such that it would be hard to accidentally knock it over.

Lamp structure:

- The lamp's plug is structurally fixed to the pole such that when the lamp is plugged in, the insertion of the plug prevents the lamp from falling over left and right.

- The base of the lamp is flush against the wall, with most of its weight close to the wall.

- The top of the lamp is small. It can be anything, but should be as light as possible. It could, for example, just end in a frosted light bulp.

Since the lamp relies on the wall for stability, it can be higher than existing floor lamps which being about as stable. It  is also inherently much more out of the way, making it less likely for accidents to happen.
