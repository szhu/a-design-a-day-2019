# :bulb: An Idea a Day

Hello, World!

I've had a lot of ideas for things I've wanted to build in the past few (2-5?) years. However, most of these ideas have never seen the light of day various reasons:
- I am lazy.
- I am too much of a perfectionist -- I tend to not be satisfied showing something to others unless I've completely thought it through and I think it's great.
- I am slow at writing down ideas eloquently and in a presentable way.

With this repo, I aim to change that! By the end of 2019, I hope to be:
- less lazy
- more okay with imperfection and works in progress
- better at striking a balance between writing fast and writing well 
…plus, I'll have a nice list of 365 ideas!

Rules:
- On each day in 2019, I will add a new idea to this repo.
- The ideas may be completely new, or it could be something I've started thinking about or working on previously. It just can't be an idea for which I've already made a detailed spec, a minimum viable product (MVP), of proof of concept.
- On some days, the idea of the day may be a significant revision/feature/improvement on a previous day's idea. No more than 1/3 of the days (<122 days) may be used to revise ideas. However, other than that, there is no limit on how many days each idea can revised.

I hope that this repo – or the ideas contained therein – inspires you as well!
